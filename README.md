# alexa-stop-the-pigeon
Alexa Skill + IoT + RaspberryPI  = No more pesky pigeons

Have you ever wanted to end the pigeon plague? If you do, this is the place!

In order to start, we are goind to need the following:

- Raspberry PI 3
- Some basic Breadboard kit
- An OWL PROP [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003EGNTPU/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&th=1]
- Some SERVOS + Pan/Til kit (So we can move the owl head around)
- Speakers
- Time. Quite a lot of it... 
- Motion sensors for future auto scare

The Idea:

You Talk to alexa and that triggers actions that get dispatched to the Thing (Pi). Those actions can be one or combinations of:
Light, sound, head movement. That will scare pigeons and they will stop coming, Hopefully... 

TBD
